# Restaurant-ChatBot

Retrieval-based chatbots are commonly used in customer service environments. User questions are constrained to the specific service being provided, which approximates a closed-domain conversation. However, people are known to be especially picky with their food. This is a chatbot system that effectively answers all of a diner’s questions about the food on a restaurant menu.

In this project I'll build a retrieval-based chatbot system for a restaurant serving Mexican cuisine. You’ll use a combination of tf-idf scoring, word embedding models, and a set of use-defined functions in order to answer any number of questions from a restaurant diner.

It's a full retrieval-based chatbot system, conversed with my own chatbot creation. 

You can improve the system by adding additional candidate responses!
